Javascript Basics Course Finale Project

This project consists in a simple web application working as a counter.

The webisite has 2 buttons (+/-) and a display button. With the first ones we can add or subtract one by clicking on them, and we'll see the resulting number on the display button in the middle.
Under those ones, there is another button used to reset the counter and start over.

The styling of the page is inspired by the classic Apple Iphone calculator app.
